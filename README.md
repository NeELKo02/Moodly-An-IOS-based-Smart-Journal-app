## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- iOS 18.5+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Apple Developer Account (for device testing)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `SmartJournal.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Select your target device
4. Build and run the project

### Model Training (Optional)
If you want to retrain the emotion detection model:

1. **Setup Python environment:**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   chmod +x setup_custom_model.sh
   ./setup_custom_model.sh
   ```

2. **Download GloVe embeddings** (2.97GB - not included in repository):
   ```bash
   # Download from Stanford NLP
   wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
   unzip glove.6B.zip
   ```

3. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python fast_85_accuracy_model.py
   ```

4. **Convert to CoreML:**
   ```bash
   python convert_to_coreml.py
   ```

**Note:** The app includes pre-trained models and works without retraining. See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed instructions.
